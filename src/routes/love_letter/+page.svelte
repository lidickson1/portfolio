        The UI has been designed to be intuitive so that even new players can
        start playing the game right away with minimal guidance. Playtesters
        were able to navigate the UI and play the game without any frustrations.
        The website also supports light and dark theme right out of the box, and
        is playable both on desktop and mobile.
        <!-- For example, every time when the user plays a card, a confirmation dialog
        is shown to prevent misclicks and to remind the user that it is an irreversible
        action. -->

        The room's host can choose to add as many bots as they want if they want
        to have more players. These bots will play cards like a normal player.
        This makes it a perfect app to kill time when you're bored.
