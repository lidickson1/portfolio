    <p class="text-slate-700 dark:text-slate-300 mb-8" data-aos="fade-up">
        The web app is very user friendly as its UI has been iterated multiple times through player
        feedback. A tutorial is also included for new players to learn how to play the game. Players
        can create their own rooms, or join other people's rooms just like in many online
        multiplayer games. The website also supports light and dark theme right out of the box, and
        is playable both on desktop and mobile.
        <!-- For example, every time when the user plays a card, a confirmation dialog
        is shown to prevent misclicks and to remind the user that it is an irreversible
        action. -->

    <p class="text-slate-700 dark:text-slate-300 mb-8" data-aos="fade-up">
        The room's host can choose to add as many bots as they want if they want to have more
        players. These bots will play cards like a normal player. Therefore, you can play this game
        as singleplayer, making it a perfect app to kill time when you're bored.
