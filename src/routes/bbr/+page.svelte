                Since its release, we have obtained more than 4000 unique player logins. Our success
                has led us to officially acquired by the #1 Minecraft gun server - <Link

                    On May 22th, 2021, we have officially announced the closure of Bayview Battle
                    Royale. The future of the server is currently in the hands of Gun Colony, and we
                    sincerely hope something good will come out of this in the future. We would also
                    like to thank all of our valuable players for being a part of the BBR community.

        Our flagship gamemode &mdash; Battle Royale, is the first to bring the mainstream game
        phenomenon of the decade to Minecraft. You drop from the plane along with 60 other players,
        gather loot and gear up while constantly keeping track of the shrinking zone. Air drops
        spawn every 5 minutes which contain the best loot. Kill or outlast the other players and the
        last man standing wins!
        <br />
        <br />
        We currently have a total of 5 expansive maps that are included in Battle Royale, each with its
        own unique landscape and locations &mdash; from the snowy tundra of Bavaria, to the dense metropolitan
        area centered around Stadium. The gamemode also has a diverse arsenal of over 20 weapons, and
        each gun uses a different caliber and supports different attachments, adding great depth to the
        gameplay.

    <p class="text-stone-300 mb-8" data-aos="fade-up">
        I developed/invented the first ever fully autonomous Minecraft FPS bots that act like real
        players. They can acquire targets, intelligently path find to various locations and
        waypoints, and can shoot remarkably well. All of the AI code is done from scratch without
        any external libraries. It has also been optimized so that it does not impact server
        performance nor eat up too many resources. The server is still able to run smooth even on
        slow/budget hardware.
        <br />
        <br />
        Having bots in matches meant that players can still have an intense gameplay experience even
        during inactive hours when there are less players online. For example, despite the fact that
        most of the players are from North America, European/Asian players are still able to have fun.
        As a result, we are able to obtain a huge increase in player engagement and longer playtime by
        300%.

            Players can choose to purchase cosmetics (with real money) to support the server. Some
            examples include gun skins, crates, wearable items, and more. A fully functional website
            (link below) was implemented that provides a modern and convenient interface for players
            to browse and buy from our store. Players can also easily equip and check out their
            cosmetics with a simple and elegant GUI.
